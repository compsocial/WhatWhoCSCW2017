3,1,"I mull over ways to answer things so people can understand not only the how but the why as well. I have heard people many times complain about those ""Christians"" who ""cram 'their' religion down people's throats."" Well, my wife sent me a quote today by email that, along with two scriptures where Jesus was talking, pretty much sums up why these people do the so-called ""cramming.""Charles H. Spurgeon said, ""If sinners be dammed, at least let them leap to Hell over our bodies. If they will perish, let them perish with our arms about their knees. Let no one go there unwarned and unprayed for.""Jesus said, ""I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me."" He also said, ""Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.""In other words, if you are believing even slightly in the ""Christian"" way to heaven, there is only one way to get there and Jesus made it plain. Those who know this hope for their loved ones, friends, neighbors, coworkers and even enemies to not have to be lost to an eternity in hell.Jesus himself also said, ""And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?"" Then he used a parable to show that those who do what he says will not be destroyed, but those who do not do what he says will end up causing themselves eternal destruction.Of course it is your choice just as it is mine. However, to not tell someone about eternal life versus eternal judgment is wrong for the person who knows as well as the one who has not yet heard. Would you prefer I let you walk in front of the bus I see heading toward you, or would you prefer I do what is necessary to get you off of that path?

Here_��s how you can do so:","When you upload a video, by default it_��s set as a _��Public_ѝ video, which means that anybody can view it. You can easily change the privacy settings of your videos. Choose it while you_��re uploading the video in the _��Privacy Settings_ѝ section or, if you_��ve already uploaded the video, change the privacy settings by following the steps below.","This section describes the command_options that are available across several CVS commands. These options are always given to the right of cvs_command. Not all commands support all of these options; each option is only supported for commands where it makes sense. However, when a command has one of these options you can almost always count on the same meaning for the option as in other commands.

182,1,"Six years ago today my baby girl was born...9 weeks early. She spent 3 weeks in the NICU. Over those 3 weeks I witnessed some of my worst nightmares come true. Her lungs weren't fully developed. She was put on a ventilator twice. Her little veins wouldn't hold an IV, they had put IVs in both of her hands and feet, and one on the top of her head. Because of this she had her first surgery to put in a direct line just above her heart...the longest 45 minutes of my life. She was unable to process formula or milk or have a bowel movement. With a tube in her nose her stomach would be emptied once a day. I argued with interns and doctors more than once, I was fighting for my baby. I won the arguments in the end. After several days I made them stop emptying her stomach every day just to see if she would process her food and have a chance to have a bowel movement, I was right. We were told that she may have developmental issues. She developed a little slow in her baby years, but nothing concerning. I prayed for her several times a day, every day. A miracle, though many may not see it this way, her mom was diagnosed with gestational diabetes. This attributed to [person's name]'s higher weight than what should be normal for a 9 week premie. She weighed a surprising 5 pounds! A bad thing for my wife that was easy to keep in check, led to my baby being a healthy weight. God works in mysterious ways, we may not understand or know the reasons, but He does. Today she has no lasting problems, she is more advanced than some kids her age. I thank God for my little miracle baby and for bringing all of us through such a difficult time. God has been shining on her since, as he does us all.I'll end with this, doctors are not always right, I have argued with many doctors for my family and myself, and been right most of the time. Know your own health, research your own health problems so you are informed and be in more control of your health. You know your body more than anybody, not the doctor you only see occasionally.",,,,,friendsonly,,wantFriendsOnly,,yes

330,1,"[person's name]It is okay to need a lot of help. Like most American girls, I was raised to be a flight attendant to my family and to the whole world, and to use my life force so that others might not flag, or feel empty, or embarrass themselves. Then that got blown to hell when the first issue of Ms Magazine came out in 1971, and the process of restoration began. It has gone a tiny tiny bit more slowly that I would have hoped. When I got sober, 28 years, a lot of the missing pieces were filled in by other female drunks, who loved me until I could love myself. Plus, I have hardly missed church in the 29 years since I converted. (You can see that there was a sort of Gap year there, between conversion and getting sober. God works in mysterious ways, Her tum-tum to perform.) Still, it takes so long to become our truest, deepest, juiciest selves--in fact, let's face facts--a lifetime.Still, all these years of healing, recovery, and radical self-care later later, I woke up yesterday, with one day off from the Small Victories book tour--although I was doing a huge fundraiser in SF that night--and I was just mad as a hatter. I'd had a nightmare, and it took me a while to re-group. (When I was still drinking, it used to take a cool refreshing beer first thing in the morning to get all the flies going in one direction.) I prayed, and yet I ""knew"" I could not do the fundraiser that night, or go back on the road to seven more cities today. As my Liverpudlian mother used to say, ""It's all over for England."" But Grace, that mysterious spiritual WD-40, spritzed me, and I did the only thing that ever really helps. I picked up the 400-pound phone, and called a girlfriend. I asked for help. She listened; I was close to tears. I told her all my scary truths, both narcissistic and full of terrible self-esteem. And she said the great, chemotherapeutic words: ""Me too."" She did not try to save or fix or rescue me, because only Love or Goodness or Howard--or whatever you want to call God--can do that. But then we started laughing. Then she prayed on me, and we talked some more, and she told me to have a huge bowl of my hippie health food cereal, and perhaps a tiny fistful ful of M&M's, which I did--when all else fails, follow directions--and I had one of the happiest days I can remember.Anyway, bless you, bless this day, and here is a funny little interview I did in London, with pretty much everything I now about anything.31 OCTOBER 2014. by PsychologiesFacebook seems an unlikely place to encounter words that leave a lasting impression on your life, but that_��s where I first found the New York Times-bestselling writer Anne Lamott. Anne is the author of seven novels, and this month, a new collection of her essays is published in the UK. Now 60, Anne lives in California where she flouts convention online, as in real life, by sharing heartfelt essay-style posts which are deeply refreshing in a virtual world of same-y status updates. Anne_��s name is not widely known in the UK, despite having 85,000 followers on Twitter and more than a quarter of a million fans on Facebook, but those who are familiar with her work often respond to the very mention of her name with reverence.We asked her to share her wisdom with Psychologies_�_How can we connect with our spirituality?By getting in touch with our own human spirit; the part that is touched by suffering throughout the world. Most people were neglected, shamed or disciplined as children in ways that stifled their creative soul and their spiritual truth. All you have to do to get back in touch with that is to want to. Start little by little; with hikes and walks, art and music.How should we deal with judgement _�� of others and ourselves?In my case, it took a lot of therapy to recover from perfectionism. And as you get older, you realise everything precious that gave you a sense of wonder and laughter came from messes and mistakes, and from people helping you get back up. I_��ve lost so many people way too young that you start to realise the sword of Damocles really is hanging over your head, and if you_��re going to live this one precious life you have, then you sure as hell better get started on it.How can we find purpose?Sometimes purpose is enduring situations that we hope not to be in forever, in order to get to somewhere more creative or that might pay out more in terms of laughter, friendships or sense of accomplishment. If you don_��t know what your purpose is, tell someone. Or write a note to God and say, _��I am adrift. Could you get back to me?_�� Then try to keep your sticky fingers off the controls of your life, and set your intentions _�� to have peace of mind, keep your sense of humour, get some exercise, and eat less sugar!Wise words from Anne Lamott_��Perfectionism is the voice of the oppressor. It will keep you very scared and restless your entire life if you do not awaken, and fight back._��_��Pick a new direction, one you wouldn_��t mind ending up at, and aim for that. Shoot the moon._��_��Forgiveness means it finally becomes unimportant that you hit back. You_��re done. It doesn_��t necessarily mean that you want to have lunch with the person._��_��It_��s good to do uncomfortable things. It_��s weight-training for life._��_��The opposite of faith is not doubt, but certainty. Certainty is missing the point entirely. Faith includes noticing the mess, the emptiness and discomfort, and letting it be there until some light returns._��_��The road to enlightenment is long and difficult and you should try not to forget snacks and magazines._��",,,,,friendsonly,,isDefault,,yes

636,1,"I just rediscovered an essay I wrote about deer when I was 16. I've attached it below.* * *In the past five years the deer populationestimate has increased 33%. This kind ofspread in unacceptable and could be damagingto the environment. The deer have thrivedin summer time, especially in the Augustarotary area.Often, when drivers crash, itis the deer who benefit and come up to feedon the car parts from the wreckage. This would not be a serious problem if it werenot for the fact that daily the Augusta rotary were not to produce at least one accident consistently. But it does, and when thathappens, deer graze upon the pieces of shatteredglass and loose metal bolts that fall fromcars onto the road.Deer have become attracted to this area andhave more frequently crossed and entered the rotaries. This has brought more huntersinto the area shooting at deer. The huntersoften miss the deer and kill driverson the rotary, whose cars resume on to crash and clog exits and make massive pileups. Of course,this means one thing and one thing only: morefood for the deers.And with the deer, more predators have come to pursue them. Bears now commonly come to the rotaries in search of deer. When they can notfind one, they are apt to roar at and violentlychase after cars driving on the road. If a bear succesfully catches a car, clenching it with its claws and crunching down on the roof,it will rip the car apart until it gets the human inside. When the bear leaves with thehuman, deer come for the ruins of the car.So in conclusion, a nuclear bomb should bedropped on the governor's building. Because, once the deer conquer the roads, that is wherethey will go next. They will go after ourleaders, and our most important people. Butif we kill all of our important leaders beforethe deer get them, maybe, just.... maybe, we might have a chance.",,,,,,most friends and family,isDefault,,yes

""Things will eventually feel natural, right? I won't alway feel like I'm treading water and don't know what I'm doing?"" Often times, though we can get caught up in the pleasant moments--the instances of surprise or joy or laughter--we are more consumed by things we perceive our shortcomings, our insecurities, our barriers.This story is incredibly sad, yes, but it's also the epitome of what everyone who perceives having the ""rest of my life"" ahead of them tends to miss--that life is so much more than just your job or career or the things we worry about. They're a part of it, but they do not define how much more there is out there to enjoy, appreciate, and experience.If I've learned anything over these past couple of years since college, it's that though we live our lives with the certainty of time, time does not take your considerations into account. We need to appreciate every moment and opportunity, good or bad, because we never know which one might be the last.""However, it was not until recently that I realized what a blessing terminal cancer has been for me. Of course, I had already accepted my fate and come to terms with cancer, but now I actually am grateful that all of this has happened to me. I realized that had I not been through all that I have been through in the past few months, I would have never come face to face with death and had to reflect and rethink about my priorities, the purpose of my life and of life in general.""",http://www.huffingtonpost.com/shalin-shah/thank-you-cancer_b_7260708.html,,,,friendsonly,,isDefault,,yes

1028,1,"Banking Fraternity Felons""The U.S. Department of Justice held a press conference in Washington, D.C. this morning at 10 a.m. to announce that two of the largest banks in the United States, Citicorp, a unit of Citigroup, and JPMorgan Chase & Co., would plead guilty to felony charges in connection with the rigging of foreign currency trading.Two foreign banks, Barclays PLC and the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), also pleaded guilty to felony charges in the same matter.A fifth bank, UBS, pled guilty to rigging the interest rate benchmark known as Libor.Today_��s felony charges fall just short of the 19th anniversary of the U.S. Justice Department charging almost every major firm on Wall Street, including JPMorgan, the predecessors of Citigroup, and UBS with fixing prices on the Nasdaq stock market. No criminal charges were brought. That now looks like a serious mistake.The Justice Department today imposed the following fines:Citicorp, which was involved from as early as December 2007 until at least January 2013, was fined $925 million;Barclays, which was involved from as early as December 2007 until July 2011, and then from December 2011 until August 2012, will pay a fine of $650 million;JPMorgan, which was involved from at least as early as July 2010 until January 2013, has agreed to pay a fine of $550 million;RBS, which was involved from at least as early as December 2007 until at least April 2010, will pay a fine of $395 million.Barclays was found to have violated its June 2012 non-prosecution agreement involving Libor and required to pay an additional $60 million criminal penalty. UBS was also found to have violated its December 2012 non-prosecution agreement and was required to plead guilty to a one-count felony charge of wire fraud in that matter and required to pay a criminal penalty of $203 million.All five banks were put on a 3-year probation which will be overseen by a Federal Court and ordered to cease all criminal activity.Other regulators imposed additional fines, bringing the total today to $5.4 billion.Related Documents Released by the Justice Department:Download Barclays Final Plea Agreement.pdfDownload Citi Plea AgreementDownload JPM Plea Agreement.pdfDownload RBS Plea Agreement.pdfDownload UBS Plea Agreement.pdfhttp://wallstreetonparade.com/_�_/_�_/banking-fraternity-felons/",http://wallstreetonparade.com/_�_/_�_/banking-fraternity-felons/,The same pic that is on the link - only larger because I posted as separate jpg,,,Public,,wantPublic,,yes

Maybe it's just me.If you've lost custody of a child or children and you're currently pregnant and still fighting..... lol. Your children should be your only focus, honestly. Get your life together.If you're going through something or have an issue with someone, please do not put it on Facebook or twitter, it doesn't make you look cool, people are not laughing with you and your rude responses, they'er laughing at you. It's embarrassing.If you're 18 or older, you should probably be in school or working on yourself, not anyone else.Females, all your posts are the same: You're either complaining about your relationship, whining about how you want a relationship, or giving other females advice about how to keep a man.

One guy mentioned that he was into learning about gemstones, so I said ""Oh yeah? If you're so smart about gemstones then how come it's ... No wait, if you know so much about gemstones then did you know that if you ... hold on. If you know so much about numbnuts then did you know ... No wait! What's the line? Let me see ... If you know so much about gemnuts ... Hahaha, wait, can I see the script? What's the line?"" At this point I was laughing in the dream and started to wake up in real life, but managed to keep dreaming enough to pull a script out of nowhere and look up the line. ""Okay! Okay. If you know so much about nutmeg ... no, wait! Okay, if you know so much about gemstones, then did you know that 'gemtun' is 'nutmeg' backwards?"" I think we still had to do another take on this line at this point since everyone in my dream was laughing, and I was laughing in real life too as i woke up fully.",,,,,friendsoffriends,,isDefault,,yes

There's also a digression into the Dream Archipelago, a place which Priest alway describes in the cool language of a travel guide but that I'm pretty happy is fictional. I only give it three stars because it isn't quite as smoothly elegant as Priest's other work and seems a little more confused than confusing at times.

203,2,"I decided to read through the Ottenwess police report. Anyone is welcome to steal my talking points:Ayling appears to be about as guilty as they get. Over the course of the police report, he makes every excuse that he thinks someone might believe, but he admitted he knew Ottenwess tried to bite someone, that he knew of the domestic assault allegations contained in the commitment petition, and that he was aware Ottenwess threw a phone. Jury says guilty.Chief Warren appears to also have known what happened. He stated he did not believe a domestic occurred because Ottenwess did not hit anyone. Surely a police chief would know that assault doesn't require someone to hit someone else. An assault is any apprehension of immediate bodily harm, and a person can be assaulted or battered with an object, say, a phone. You'd think Chief Warren would have learned such basic things somewhere along the line.The Chief also blames HIPPA for not reporting the domestic. Can we all use HIPPA to avoid criminal liability for things we do while intoxicated, or does HIPPA only apply when you are super, duper, drunk, and a city employee? the Chief appears to be in this up to his eyeballs.Sgt Gillis also appeared to be in cover-up mode from the get-go, and if anything, started it sooner than Ayling did, by stating that he recognized Ottenwess and then immediately changed his tune to ""we're here to help you."" Do police typically tell people they pull over, or people they investigate for other crimes, that they're there to help? Oh right, they don't.Sgt. Gillis also reported that Ottenwess struggled with officers on the way to an observation room, and that the situation was only a medical ""because the man was extremely intoxicated."" Of course, we all know that intoxication does not negate intent for domestic violence, or resisting and opposing a law enforcement officer.These statements on the part of the Chief Warren and Sgt. Gillis are highly incriminating. Why are they not also being charged? Is Chief Warren retiring so as to avoid prosecution?Ottenwess' blood alcohol content was a .395. By all accounts, he is lucky to be alive. By comparison, the legal limit is .08. In order for a person to have an alcohol content that high, and not be dead or passed out, they must have a huge alcohol problem.Why did Prosecutor Bob Cooney ask the Grand Traverse Sheriff's Office, rather than the Michigan State Police Mission Team, to investigate the allegations against Ayling? You would have to think that this incident is going to make the relationship between GTSO and the City Police icy, to say the least. Cooney is employed by the County, just like the GTSO.Also, I have to wonder why Cooney is so aggressive about stepping into politically hot cases where a conflict might exist, such as this one. I have to wonder if ""Cooney for 13th Circuit Judge"" signs are coming to a front yard near you in the next election cycle.Perhaps we could improve police accountability by recording all conversations on any law enforcement phone lines. Though this would likely drive law enforcement personnel to go all Hillary Clinton and move the really corrupt stuff to their personal servers.Why aren't Chief Warren and Sgt Gillis also answering to the same charge as Captain Ayling?",,,,,custom,friends except a few people I don't trust,levelOfComfort,,yes

Then... the editing begins!So I will leave tonight with this from Meat Loaf:I remember everything!I remember every little thing as if it happened only yesterday.I was barely seventeen and I once killed a boy with a Fender guitarI don't remember if it was a Telecaster or a Stratocaster,but I do remember that it had a heart of chrome and a voice like a horny angel!I don't remember if it was a Telecaster or a Stratocaster,but I do remember that it wasn't at all easy.It required the perfect combination of the correct power chords,and the precise angle from which to strike.The guitar bled for a week afterward and the blood was - ooh -dark and rich like wild berries.The blood of the guitar was Chuck Berry red.The guitar bled for about a week afterward but it rung out beautifully,and I was able to play notes that I had never even heard before.So, I took my guitar and I smashed it against the wall,I smashed it against the floor,I smashed it against the body of a varsity cheerleader,I smashed it against the hood of a car,I smashed it against a 1981 Harley Davidson.The Harley howled in pain.The guitar howled in heat.And I ran up the stairs to my parents' bedroom.Mommy and Daddy were sleeping in the moonlight.Slowly I opened the door, creeping in the shadows,right up to the foot of their bed.I raised the guitar high above my head,and just as I was about to bring the guitar crashing down upon the centre of the bed,my father woke up screaming:""Stop! Wait a minute! Stop it boy! What do you think you're doing?That's no way to treat an expensive musical instrument!""And I said ""God dammit Daddy! You know I love you,but you've got a hell of a lot to learn about rock and roll!""",,,,,friendsonly,,wantFriendsOnly,,yes

351,2,"Desiderata by Max EhrmannGo placidly amid the noise and the haste,and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible, without surrender, be on good terms with all persons.Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others,even to the dull and the ignorant; they too have their story.Avoid loud and aggressive persons; they are vexatiousto the spirit. If you compare yourself with others,you may become vain or bitter, for alwaysthere will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans.Keep interested in your own career, however humble;it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.Exercise caution in your business affairs, for the world is full of trickery.But let this not blind you to what virtue there is;many persons strive for high ideals,and everywhere life is full of heroism.Be yourself. Especially do not feign affection.Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment,it is as perennial as the grass.Take kindly the counsel of the years,gracefully surrendering the things of youth.Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune.But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings.Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself.You are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars;you have a right to be here.And whether or not it is clear to you,no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.Therefore be at peace with God,whatever you conceive Him to be.And whatever your labors and aspirations,in the noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soul.With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams,it is still a beautiful world.

And how did I know which tire it was?!?! I wanted to know if you saw the dress as gold and white or black and blue. Who did you have winning the NCAA tournament and far were the packers going to go? We went to Hawaii and swam in a waterfall and got washed up on shore by the waves and talked about how much you would have loved it, but it would have been WAY WAY to hot for you. I want your help picking out a new computer since mine is slowly dying and do I really need to replace the cabin air filter in my car? What would you think about Brock and I running the marathon in 2 weeks and how do you think I did in my half in September.

I've reached a point where it's like ""why even live?""But the strange part is, it isn't like a suicidal ""why live?"" It's more of a philosophical/general bored of life type of why live. What's my purpose even? What is my ""duty"" so to speak here on this beautiful planet we live on? I have money, I earn money, more money than I ever have earned before, but every day I go to bed feeling empty. Movies don't excite me. Games don't excite me. Nothing does, aside from food and maybe 1 or 2 people. Life is boring. I'm literally bored of life and these are supposed to be some of the most exciting times of life. In fact, life is so boring that on a general day I can tell you my exact schedule. I wake up around 7-8, I shower, I eat, I go straight to work. At around 12 I eat lunch then back to work. At around 5-6 I eat dinner then go straight back to work. Then I usually quit around 9-10, at which point I'm too tired even to relax or unwind at all. All I do literally is work and eat. That's it.

699,2,"I've seen this around a bit, so I'm going to post it with my own two cents. Also, because it's simultaneously disgusting and hilarious--the fact of the matter is independent of video or cameras, no one should act this way. Ever. No excuses. And just because you're caught on camera doesn't make you a victim. A bit of background with article and video link below:The Kessler in Oak Cliff kicked these women out of a show for being disruptive. The Kessler, like most other venues, has a clear policy on concert going behavior. While most of the commentary and write-ups I've seen related to this video have been supportive of the Kessler in this incident due to the behavior these women demonstrated in the video, a discussion has also come-up on social media shaming.While I agree with a lot of statements commonly made with regards to shaming on social media--namely that it happens more often that it should--I feel like it is not applicable in this case. When a patron of a business is disruptive and threatening to be destructive, a business needs to defend itself from liability. The video was only made public after one of the parties involved made a scathing yelp review that was contradicted by the video. In order for someone to be shamed, the statements or actions of the person involved are deplorable--and in this case, making ignorant racist and LGBT comments not only meet this mark, but deserve to be shamed.I applaud the Kessler for sticking to its rules and making sure its patrons have an enjoyable experience, as opposed to other locations, where complaints are met with multiple warnings and no action.Disclaimer to my non-Dallas friends: I promise not all Dallasites are this ignorant.",,,,,friendsonly,,wantFriendsOnly,,yes

1027,2,"Bye, BYE [person's name]...(I had received word about this, last weekend - held off for confirmation)_��Many people are concerned about what is happening in Europe. There is a lot of fear concerning whether or not Greece will drop out of the euro. What people are not watching is the kind of infrastructure spending that China is announcing..._��But aside from the infrastructure spending, China is also aggressively spending money on its military. People forget but the U.S. won the Cold War against Russia because we outspent the Russians and Russia couldn_��t keep up.China's Upgraded MilitaryNow we are seeing constant releases about China_��s upgraded military. This has to do with everything from their fleet of submarines to fighter jets. But what_��s interesting is that the Chinese do not need a large military to control the entire world.Regardless, China is putting a lot of resources into its military and this is putting additional pressure on the West, particularly the United States. This will also put additional pressure on the U.S. balance sheet.This also paves the way for China_��s yuan to be part of the IMF_��s SDR. So the odds of the yuan becoming part of the IMF_��s SDR have greatly increased.But even if the yuan does not become part of the IMF_��s SDR, maybe the IMF ceases to be important because if China backs the yuan with gold it will be game over.That would make the BRICS bank the dominant monetary institution.Shift In Balance Of Power And The All-Important QuestionEither way, Eric, the balance of power is rapidly shifting in inexorably from the West to the East. The all-important question is: How much gold does China really have? The answer is they have thousands of tons. How many thousands of tons remains to be seen.But the other important question is: How much gold does the West have left? KWN has reported many times that it is extremely hard to find any banks that have any gold in their vaults in the West. In contrast to that, it_��s very easy for anyone to buy gold from virtually any bank in the East and the Middle East for that matter.So the world is nearing the point where the yuan is about to ascend on the international arena. The second major event will be when gold becomes part of the IMF_��s SDR and possibly even backs the Chinese yuan.China's Move That Will Send Gold SkyrocketingIf gold backs the yuan, that will be disastrous for the West, particularly the United States because inflation will take off and gold will skyrocket to a number that people can_��t even fathom at this point. The bottom line is that when you see any deep declines in gold or silver, just buy them._ѝ",,A turtle by a pond,,,friendsonly,,isDefault,,yes

Instead use your hands for good hard work, and then give generously to others in need. Don't use foul or abusive language. Let everything you say be good and helpful, so that your words will be an encouragement to those who hear them. And do not bring sorrow to God's Holy Spirit by the way you live. Remember, he has identified you as his own, guaranteeing you will be saved on the day of redemption. Get rid of all bitterness, rage, anger, harsh words, and slander, as well as all types of evil behavior. Instead be kind to each other, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, just as God through Christ has forgiven you.""

We did our usual thing of talking to/about the cat, and my friend remarked about how one cat was following another. I looked across the street trying to see if she meant that cat was being followed or was doing the following, and then I saw a cat following that one a little bit behind. That cat heard us, and looked over to us as it sat on the sidewalk. As the cat looked over, I noticed that he had one eye. I mean, not like one was missing, just one big Mike Wazowski eye in the middle of his face. He looked at us as we said some random things about him, then he pointed at his eye with one finger (Digit?

44,3,"It seems impossible that four years have gone by since my dad went to Heaven. I can still remember events from the last week of his life as if they just happened. I can remember the moment he accepted Jesus as his Savior. I can remember him asking me to promise him that I would get everyone to love each other and to love God. I can remember how many people were in his ICU room as he left this world and entered into eternity with God, and I remember the overwhelming peace that God gave me through all of this. I remember [person's name] fulfilling Dad's last request to him as he went to be with God. A request that still amazes me to this day. He gave [person's name] a time the following day, and asked him to tell everyone about God at that time. The time was when his ICU room was filled with over 20 family members, the exact time that he went to be with God. I can remember the blind man who found and sat with me in a nearly empty cafeteria and prayed with me, telling me it was divine intervention.The last week of my dad's life was all about God. And, even though my dad was referring to family when he asked me to promise him what he did, it is really about all of us. Believing in God is not enough. It's about living for God. Jesus died on the cross for me and YOU. Do you understand the story of the cross? I know most of us know it, but do you understand it? He saved all of us that day. He didn't just save the people who were around when he walked the earth. He also went up on that cross for me, for my dad, and for you. Why? Because he loves us (present tense, not past!).If you have not accepted Jesus as your Savior, I ask you from the bottom of my heart to spend some time today thinking about the cross. You may not live another day here on earth. While you are here, you can make a choice though. Don't think you have years, because you may not even have hours. My dad's doctor said he would be fine. Instead, four months after his diagnosis, we buried him. I thank God that he is in my future though. Because he accepted Jesus as his Savior, because he understood four days before he took his last breath just what the cross means, I have an eternity with him too.For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.

326,3,"I really hope this doesn't happen here. Sure, digital has many advantages over regular AM/FM broadcasts but if you want digital there's not really anything keeping you from accessing it. I'd say the radio stations in America will fight the conversion but as much as Clear Channel/Live Nation/iHeartRadio is pushing their streaming app, I'm not so sure. They'd probably be fine pulling the plug if they can get iHeartRadio to be a dominate force. Cumulus and LM Communications maybe not so much. And what about WRFL, WUKY, and all the other independent radio stations? If Republicans have Congress and the White House in 2016, you can bet they'll be happy to make a campaign that public broadcasting is costing the taxpayers too much money and only pushes a liberal agenda. As long as Hannity and Rush are secure over on iHeartRadio, they're happy.There's something comforting about knowing I can flip on my old 70s Sears radio and hear Coast to Coast AM crackling through the air at 3 in the morning or switch it over to FM and catch up on the news on WEKU or the weirdness of WRFL. I also look at it as a safety issue. If the internet, cable, or cell services goes down we're in the dark. Terrestrial radio would be the only way to disperse critical information in an emergency.

696,3,"I posted this on a thread of an article that got taken down, but I wanted to post it again because I stand by it and think it needs to be addressed on [university]'s campus. For outsiders, [university] has Greek clubs (which I'm apposed to their induction/initiation process) and Fraternities/sororities (I have no problem with/haven't gone through).As someone who went through a Greek clubs induction then chose to leave the organization, I can assure you that hazing did happen (definition: any action taken or any situation created intentionally that causes embarrassment, harassment or ridicule and risks emotional and/or physical harm to members of a group or team, whether new or not, regardless of the person_��s willingness to participate.). Hazing happens to be illegal in TN, and whether or not you agree doesn't change the premise. And despite if ""hazing"" is the believed correct term and qualifies as illegal (a matter of semantics), the process was degrading and demeaning. And yes I understood ""why"" I had to endure it from the ""Greek's perspective"", a kid could reason their conclusion (but come up with holier means).Also, much of induction wasn't godly at all, hence why I left (for basic, 101 attestation examine; 1 Thessalonians 5:11, Romans 12:10, 14:19, Ephesians 4:29-32, Colossians 2:23, 3:12, 1 Corinthians 13:4-8, 15:33, Proverbs 6:16-19 {just to name a few}). Here's a summary of the verses- God commands us to build each other up rather than break each other down.My point: how can one orchestrating/participating in induction read those passages/Bible without conviction? Does Christ ever say, ""You can forget some of my commandments so long as the ends justify the means""? Please, share your thoughts, I'm earnestly interested.Finally, it doesn't mean that there isn't anything valuable or biblical within the clubs holistically, I would truly suggest the opposite. Brotherhood/sisterhood is invaluable and should be pursued. I've even thought about rejoining in the past because many of the benefits can outweigh the negatives. Truthfully, the purpose of this is not to condemn, rather challenge. My hope is for US ALL to stand up against Christian unrighteousness, or simply disassociate the name of Christ with that which we are involved.",,Collage of mom and grandma,,,friendsonly,,wantFriendsOnly,,yes

In a recent turn of events however, this has become way easier because I've finally realized that not everyone (close to no one) will have my back as I have had his or hers. Trying not to let circumstance change who I am....but maybe it's supposed to.An Open Letter To The Friends That Walked Out Of My LifeToday someone asked me how you are, and I realized that I don't know.I couldn't tell you which classes you've been taking. I couldn't tell you who you spend your days with, and I couldn't tell you what's important in your life lately. Or, who is important in your life (clearly, not me). I don't know, and I realized that I haven't known for a while.It's a funny thing, change, because I used to know everything. I used to talk to you every day, and I could tell you all of your little quirks, antics, and daily adventures. Hell, I used to be a part of them. But now, I'm not, and I haven't been for a while.You all too gracefully walked out of my life, took your final bow, and exited stage left. I was just a scene in the movie that is your life and the curtain finally went down on me, leaving me in the dark.You know, I used to miss you, our inside jokes, our nonsensical conversations, and our wild adventures. I used to miss that friendship so much. But, I never felt like you missed me, or even remembered and missed the things that I did. So, eventually I stopped missing you.I used to be mad too. I was so angry at how you could just walk out of my life and forget about me, and it made me both sad and mad at the same time, making me think I hated you.So, it took me a while, but I've slowly come to the realization that a ""friend"" isn't someone that only texts you when they want, or when they need something. It's not someone that just makes small-talk with you and waves at you from across the bar, and it's definitely not someone who doesn't know how you are. Or, who you are because let's be honest, it doesn't take long for life to come around and change people.To me, you've become someone that I used to know. Not for lack of caring, but because quietly, without you ever really noticing it, you stopped knowing who I was. You stopped asking how I was and, in that time, I've changed. I bet you don't know about my latest struggles and triumphs. If you do, you haven't congratulated me or asked me if I'm doing okay.It took me way too long to realize that you shouldn't stay friends with people who never ask how you are. In simpler words, you don't know how I am, and you never asked.But, in case you were wondering, I'm not sad. I'm not mad, and I don't hate you. The thing is, I just don't care anymore.I'm sorry if that sounds harsh, but I don't. I let go of you just like you let go of me. But sometimes, I do wonder how you are.And, I hope that one day someone asks you how I am.I hope you realize that you don't know. And, I hope you miss me and I hope it hurts.*P.S. I also hope that someone crazy like Taylor Swift comes along and throws your phone in a fountain, or totals your car with a golf club.*[person's name]",http://www.history.com/news/hungry-history/mcdonalds-surprising-start-75-years-ago,n/a,n/a,,friendsonly,,wantFriendsOnly,,yes

Most of the dream took place in some sort of factory warehouse trying to find my way back home.The other dream I had was about some sort of Pokթmon-like game. My main character was a little orb that could become any creature it touched (a bit like a Ditto), and I was trying to get one specific creature. I missed and touched a puppy-like creature with a long tail instead, and everyone around me started making ""aww"" noises because it was one of the cuter ones. I jumped around with this new creature, trying to get the one creature I wanted, but found that this creature's ability was that it inflated other creatures. I remember looking at the sprites to see how they would be able to animate so many different creatures getting inflated, and saw that the heads stayed the same size, a new face was put on, and the body just became a giant circle with its own pallet.",,,,,friendsoffriends,,isDefault,,yes

5,4,"I got this message from my vet today. Does anyone know anything about this/has experienced this in their own dog(s)? ""Due to an unknown and unidentified canine upper respiratory virus threatening our community, we are recommending that all of our cute, lovable and furry canine friends be vaccinated for and protected against Canine Influenza Virus (CIV). In order to encourage vaccination for this highly contagious disease, we are reducing the cost of the CIV vaccine to $25. Supplies are limited so please read the important information below from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to help keep your dog safe and call us today to schedule your dog's appointment to receive the CIV vaccine.Because this virus is widespread in our area, we are requiring that all patients staying at our hospital be vaccinated for CIV before their scheduled visit. Pets must be vaccinated 2 weeks prior to boarding reservations. Please understand that this is in the best interest of your pet_��s health and is necessary for us to protect our patients.From the CDC:Canine Influenza Virus VaccineDo to the recent outbreak of Canine Influenza in Illinois -- where over 1,000 dogs were affected and five canine deaths reported -- we have added a new vaccine to our dog vaccine recommendations. The canine influenza vaccine will be a 'lifestyle' vaccine for dogs at risk of exposure. Canine influenza (CIV) is a highly contagious respiratory infection in dogs. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), because this is a newly emerging disease, virtually all dogs, regardless of breed or age, are susceptible to infection and have no immunity. Candidates for this vaccine are any of those attending or coming from shelters, kennels, doggie daycares, veterinary clinics, dog parks, dog shows, training and agility settings, pet shops and any multi-dog facilities. CIV is easily transmitted by direct contact, a cough or sneeze, or via contaminated surfaces. Cases have been identified in 31 states including Georgia. The vaccination protocol includes an initial vaccine with a second booster given 2-4 weeks later. The vaccine should be given to healthy dogs, 8 weeks of age or older and is boosted for at risk dogs to provide complete protection.Our hospital is committed to providing your dog the most comprehensive care in the industry and we are happy to answer any questions you may have about Canine Influenza.""",,,,,friendsonly,,isDefault,,yes

But at least it's manageable by just giving her a higher dose of steroids and pain medications. Other than that she should be home within a few days. I'm not worried at all because the doctor has been so sweet to her in taking care of her when it wasn't even his responsibility because he's just an oncologist/hematologist, not a gastroenterologist.

388,4,"Looking back on the night...If you weren't at the Roche tonight for the [person's name]'s Birthmasapalooza you missed out on one GLORIOUSLY TOP-QUALITY spectacle of comedic bizarre improv built on an equally bizarre collection of premises that developed over a course of vaguely dedicated months, resulting in a perfect storm of the absurd. You honestly missed an event people will remember fondly for YEARS. An event of fucked up that was worth paying for, purely for the sheer sake of what you saw. You missed a display of goddamned ENTERTAINMENT.And on top of that (I'm focusing on the stage comedy standpoint, don't think I'm diminishing these folks at all), the music from Biblical Proportion, Lake Effect, and Pee.Tzu kicked all kinds of ass too.Thanks to my co-offenders from [location], beginning with [person's name] (who apparently now lives in [location], which means her ex-bf [person's name] might have sold her into slavery as a race horse*), [person's name] who gleefully donated his beard to the first-EVER live human face-to-face transplant. To [person's name] for co-developing the genesis of Operation: Cream on Txx for his Birthday and it's messy aftermath. And though she wasn't on stage, thanks to [person's name] for fully encouraging the weird stuff the collection of us fraudulents come up purely because we find it funny. Thanks to.[person's name] for doing a fine job of going along with an idea and helping abuse [person's name] appropriately, and giving the event the tiny bit of asshole tension only a cop bring. You could *feel* the pleasure Officer [person's name] had cuffing [person's name]. And, thanks to Little Mrs [person's name] for happily being the second person to hit her Brother-in-law in the face with a gooey bowl of creamy, wet, squishy, sticky, whippity do.[Of course, thanks to [person's name] for having me again. I genuinely appreciate the opportunity to host your birthday. It's an honor, in the most ""why the fuck do I even like this idiot? Oh yeah, he's my kind of idiot, and doesn't mind my idiocy either,"" kind of way.Thanks to [person's name]for her willingness to play along, and trying so hard to raise [person's name] to be a grownup someday. That man loves loves you, and you're the most patient woman any of us know.[city]'ss Official Unofficial Mayor [person's name] did his job pretty damned well, too, tonight.Considering the reality that every and ALL [festival name] Festivals dive right into chaos at the first sign of beer, and ALWAYS end in a glorious train wreck of celebrating Tim's existence that is guaranteed - GUARANTEED - to end up in a messy, we're-all-bascially-12-years-old-at-heart way...that went really well. We improv-ed liked the gods we can be, and rolled with whatever came our way as it it came to mind. It wasn't perfect, but it was the best anything can be when [person's name] is involved. I honestly think we should all be proud, especially when - again - it's in the context of ""[person's name] was involved."" We didn't just ""put on a show for [person's name]'s Birthday, "" we gave our and the Birthday boy audience a MEMORY.As the host and ring leader and ring master of this annual fiasco, I was proud to work with all of you last night. Ringmastering the ""[person's name] Wants Abuse and Attention and He Wants it NOW""- night feels kind of like a finely honed skill at this point, and every single one of you made the night's events better. At this point, it's become an annual party and spectacle that isn't getting the credit it's due.Just wait'll you see what happens next year, people on the other side of the fourth wall of this status.. It'll be spectacular.And, of course, thank you to [location] for supporting local everything, being good sports, and allowing creativity and just plain goofy fun a place to call home. Where else are you going to see hip-hop goodness moments after a man has had the hair of others glued to his face in celebration of the fact he hasn't sat in the middle of the street in a plastic chair and been hit by a police car yet? The shit you let us get away with is truly appreciated.That was fun, and something I'd have actually paid money to watch from the audience. And been so damned glad I did when it was over. People who weren't there missed an honestly historical local event. And a really fun whipped cream fight at the end of the night.Yeah, that's right [person's name]...where the hell were you?TL,DR: These are real thoughts. Read 'em, see an expression of appreciation, or go choke on a meme.TL,DR: Fuck you, read words or choke on meme.TL,DR: Read or choke on a meme.TL,DR: Fuck [person's name]!*fun fact: 86.4932% of you won't get ALL of that joke, but [person's name] will.",,,,,friendsonly,,isDefault,,yes

Arrange marriages always felt like blind dates; only difference being parents or relatives arranged the dates. I first saw [person's name] at a community function where she was the host for the evening. Appealing and highly sophisticated, I knew she was too pretty for me; more like a Mercedes Benz that can_��t be owned but only admired.My belief in destiny however was retained the day when her family showed interest in ours. Clueless who the girl is, I kept denying considering it was an arranged proposal. But after days of convincing done by my family, I gave in and agreed to meet her once. I was in for a sweet shock when I realised the girl is the same Mercedes I was admiring. I found my _��no_ѝ slowly turning to a yes. After being allowed to share some personal talks in a separate room, we spoke a lot and I was won over, but partially. The second time we met convinced me completely that she is the one for me. I could picture her as my friend, wife, life-partner and as a mother to my children. When I imagined 20 years further, I saw myself happy. Now married for 12 years there is nothing that I want to go back and change. Her remarkable understanding towards my busy schedule is something that I adore and respect the most. In fact her understanding is 10% more than mine, which makes our relation going smoothly.In the last 12 years both of us have ensured that we don_��t go to bed with our differences. We talk it out, fight it out but welcome each day with a smile. Now after so many years I am still glad I decided to take the leap of faith with her.

700,4,"May is Mental Health Month and having worked as a Mental Health Professional (and majoring in Psychology), it is a topic that is very important to me.I've been posting a lot of related information, but this article from ESPN I've seen a lot today is more than just an infographic or a study, and I will repost it here for those who haven't seen it. It's a true look at the way mental illness plays out in a person's life.It's so easy to fake being well. Social media especially provides this opportunity, because it's not only a way to keep in touch or document life, but also to show it off. But we don't have to do that, and we certainly shouldn't. I say this because I struggle with it a lot--pretending to be doing well when I'm not. So I want to remind each and everyone one of you out there--whether we speak a lot or not at all, whether I know you well, or don't, or even if we're not on the best of terms--if you ever think you might even kind of need help or a listening ear--I am here for you. My phone is on 24/7 and I am just a text, phone call or FB chat away. So long as it is in my power to answer, I will do so, and will never intentionally ignore you. If you want a fresh pair of ears to listen and say nothing, or advice or anything in between, I will be there.If you'd rather not talk to me or would like to find a different method, NAMI.org has great local resources listed on their page (just put your state), or call the National Suicide Hotline (suicidepreventionlifeline.org )Learn from [person's name] story. Specifically: ""EVERY YEAR, MORE than 40,000 Americans die by suicide. Among young adults, ages 10 to 24, suicide is the second-leading cause of death, with more than 4,500 young people taking their lives each year. ""and""[person's name] listened patiently, but the news surprised him. [person's name] seemed to have lost perspective, was seeing through a blurred lens, like some kind of dysmorphia. She had excelled in school (GPA of 3.5) and in track during the first semester, despite her constant fears that she was failing at both.

Which is not to say that those are just click-bait sensationalist headlines (though I suspect that is at least a small part of it.)More so, I think it has to do with several divides in how people get their news. Younger people, I suspect are less likely to ever be getting their news from ""the news"" or tv or radio and are much more likely to be getting articles or pictures or tweets selected by their social media.So the other divide then, is what kinds of people you are connected to via social media - which is self selecting and often a self reinforcing divide.As a result, I imagine a large percentage, if not most, of the people seeing and sharing these ""no one is talking about ____"" articles are the people who have been seeing such things the entire time.",,,,,friendsonly,,wantFriendsOnly,,yes

327,5,"Congratulations to [person's name] are in order for twenty years in business as the owner of [company name]. It hasn't been easy for local, independent record stores to survive in the 21st century but [person's name]'s odd knack for both stubbornly opposing and enthusiastically embracing change has served his store well. As an employee for six years total (off and on from 1999 until 2014), I can attest to just how different things are now than they were in the beginning. [company name] wasn't my first job in a record store; I'd previously been the last employee of [company name], a long-running record shop in the basement of the [company name] building next-door. I loved buying vinyl from [company name], which is probably how I ended up getting offered a job there, but people like me were rarities. When I lived in the dorms across the street, I don't think I'd be exaggerating much to say I was probably the only person on my floor (or even North Campus) with a turntable and a large shelf full of records. [company name] had been selling vinyl on campus since 1979 so when it closed along with [company name] (another long-running record shop) it was the end of an era in a way. The late 1990s were a great time to buy vinyl but those on the other side of the register were often forced to close up shop as the vinyl loyalists dwindled in number.Soon after [company name] took over [company name]'s former location next door to [company name], I was hired by [company name] to join his crew. This was an entirely different game; the store had vinyl but was overwhelmingly devoted to CDs and had a healthy stock of new releases on hand every Tuesday. Reading the article below, I see that the CD industry's sales peaked in 2000 to 2001. I believe that. Downloading wasn't much of an option then. It was there, but you had to really work at it, know what you were doing, and have lots of patience as each song seemed to take ten to fifteen minutes (gasp!) to download. It seems crazy now, but we would have midnight sales on Monday nights when a big new release would come out. The one that stuck out to me was when Radiohead's Kid A came out. We had a line stretching down the block to buy the new CD at midnight. There wasn't any other way to hear it back then, unless you worked in radio or a record store and had access to a coveted advance promo CD, so hardcore fans lined up for our midnight opening. Release days were big events, and sales were great.You know the rest of the story...Napster, iTunes, etc. Fast forward to 2012 when I was winding down my stint as a concert promoter, leaving my job at a law office, and going back to UK to finish my degree. I ran into [person's name] at Kroger, had a chat, and was invited to return to CD Central. I took him up on it, partly because I was burned out on law, but also because I missed working in a record store.It took me a while to get used to seeing so many records go across the counter as opposed to CDs. It was a bit of a shock, actually. Frat boys weren't supposed to come in indie record stores and ask for [company name] ""vinyls"". Didn't they know vinyl was the exclusive realm of misfits and record nerds like myself? I'm joking, of course. Mostly. But seriously, these kids need to learn the plural of vinyl is vinyl. Kills me.[person's name] has a great thing going over there on S. Limestone. He's stuck with it through the hardest of times. Surely he's thought of closing over the years. It's a tough business with a finicky clientele. He's no doubt had increasingly tempting offers on the building as he's watched investors pick off the extant mom-and-pop businesses and replace them with Chipotle, Local Taco, Tin Roof, Noodles and Co., Jimmy John's, etc. Pazzo's demolished the building between it and Cx Cxxxxxx, expanded, and now towers ominously next door. All of the new businesses make me appreciate the formerly out-of-place McDonald's in some odd way. It still sticks out like a sore thumb after being coated in bubbling hot fry grease and submerged in coffee hotter than the Earth's magma, yet it's familiar and somehow welcoming in its gaudy blue and whiteness.I'm way off track. Point is, let's all appreciate the hard work [person's name] and my fellow co-workers have put into keeping [company name] open these 20 years. Let's also thank the customers who have made it all possible. Other cities have lost their flagship indie record stores, yet Lexington's [company name] still stands. If you've never been there and you live in [city], shame. Fix that this week. If you've shopped there but not in a while, make a point to drop by the store and see what's new. Perhaps you're a regular. Thanks, of course, but maybe on your next time in the store take a moment to tell [person's name] and the crew how much you appreciate the place...and his dog.The plural of vinyl is still vinyl.",http://www.kentucky.com/welcome_page/?shf=/2015/04/12/3797531_thanks-for-indie-music-the-resurgence.html,,,,Public,,isDefault,,yes

1438,5,"This is pretty amazing. And I didn't write any of it incidentally, it's all from the site listed at the bottom.As many know, Jesus didn't die for anyone's sins. Church authorities made that up. Jesus is not God's only son. We are all God's children. Those who don't follow Him, will not be sent to hell. He doesn't send anyone to hell.People are responsible for their own sins (mistakes/errors). Jesus can't end corruption, war & poverty for us. He can (and does) help, but we have to do most of the work. Also, He does not want to be worshipped. Worshipping Him creates a barrier to understanding.Bible thumpers repeat what the corrupt & ignorant church fathers, who ruled by fear, who burned people to death at the stake for questioning their authority, who took little boys to bed with them, want their sheep to believe, but it's not true. Even if 300 million people believe a huge lie, it remains a lie.Seek the truth & it will set you free from superstious ignorance perpetuated by lies created by ignorant, power thirsty men.------------------------------------------------------""No one saves us but ourselves, no one can and no one may. We ourselves must walk the path but Buddhas [enlghtened beings] show the way."" Guatama Buddha------------------------------------------------------""...the church has hindered down the centuries, & has not helped because of its fanatical zeal to make ""Christians"" of all peoples & not followers of the Christ... It has emphasized theological doctrine, & not love & loving understanding as Christ exemplified it. The Church has preached the fiery Saul of Tarsus & not the gentle Carpenter of Galilee...""The work and the teaching of the Christ will be hard for the Christian world to accept, though easier of assimilation in the East. Nevertheless, some hard blow or some difficult presentation of the truth is badly needed if the Christian world is to be awakened, and if Christian people are to recognise their place within a worldwide divine revelation and see the Christ as representing all the faiths and taking His rightful place as World Teacher.""He is the World Teacher and not a Christian teacher. He Himself told us that He had other folds and to them He has meant as much as He has meant to the orthodox Christian. They may not call Him Christ, but they have their own name for Him and follow Him as truly and faithfully as their Western bretheren.""...the Gospel story... has been twisted and distorted by theologians until the crystalline purity of the early teaching and the unique simplicity of the Christ have disappeared in a travesty of errors and in a mummery of ritual, money, & human ambitions.""Christ is pictured today as having been born in an unnatural manner, as having taught and preached for three years and then as having been crucified and eventually resurrected, leaving humanity in order to ""sit on the right hand of God,"" in austere and distant pomp.""Likewise, all the other approaches to God by any other people, at any time and in any country, are regarded by the orthodox Christian as wrong approaches, as being practiced by so-called ""heathen,"" and as requiring Christian interference.""Every possible effort has been made to force orthodox Christianity on those who accept the inspiration and the teachings of the Buddha or of others who have been responsive for preserving the divine continuity of revelation...",http://www.mindlight.info/aab/dkrap.htm,n/a,n/a,n/a,Public,,wantPublic,,yes

1181,6,"5 years ago today, in the early morning hours, my house (well pretty much the whole block) burned down and we lost almost everything. It was crazy to be homeless out of the blue like that and in the years to come, we went through so much and a lot of those times weren't great. It took a long long time to get back on our feet and recover, not just monetarily but mentally. We were helped by a lot of people along the way and even though some of those situations ended badly, I am eternally grateful to the people who were there for us in our worst times. And I'm happy to say that I think I'm finally over it. I feel like we're in such a better place now and I didn't even have nightmares or panic attacks leading up to it this year.

1230,6,"From my perspective, the average cop in America is the guy or gal next door, who goes to work, tries to do some good in the world, and comes home to their family, happy to make it back, safe and sound. They are the person who takes pride in their work, wants to do a good job, who doesn't lie, or cheat, or steal, who wants to serve their fellow man. They do so much good, every minute, every hour, of every day, of every week, of every year. They try and promote the good, and confront the bad, uplift the weak and the poor, and protect those that can't protect themselves. And just like any profession from reporter to politician, to doctor, lawyer, or clergyman, there are those that do it for the wrong reasons and disgrace the profession. And eventually they are found out, weeded out, and made to atone for their crimes. But the public doesn't see all that. They see the sensationalized accounts that the media portrays of ""combat warrior police"" who only live to oppress, terrorize, assault, and kill. And I am so tired of it. The times when a police officer or officers are caught doing wrong, or abusing their power is news because its noteworthy, out of the ordinary, ""exciting,"" and will ultimately increase ratings. The media portrays events that are extraordinary, as in not the norm.

1439,6,"E-CIG RANT: I am so sick of people talking about how e-cigs are bad. E-cigs are worse for you than tobacco products. E-cigs are full of chemicals. E-cigs cause cancer. You name it. And the funny thing about all of these claims is: THEY ARE ALL WRONG. FACTS: There are very few ingredients and they are all perfectly safe to inhale. The only thing e-cigs actually have in common with tobacco cigarettes is the nicotine. 1) Vegetable Glycerin 2) Propylene Glycol 3) Food Grade Artificial Flavoring 4) Food Grade Dye 5) Nicotine (The only toxic ingredient. E-liquid is available without it. FYI) CLAIM: But propylene glycol is in antifreeze! I'm not inhaling that! TRUTH: Wrong. Diethylene glycol is the main ingredient in antifreeze. And yes IT IS very toxic. But propylene glycol is not. Not small amounts anyway. And it is not in antifreeze. It happens to be the main ingredient asthma inhalers (albuterol), flonase, etc. It is perfectly safe to inhale. If you still think it's dangerous, maybe you should stop using your inhalers, too. CLAIM: They cause cancer. I heard that from [insert idiotic information source]. TRUTH: No they do not. And as some of us who actually research cancer and what causes it will tell you is that there are at least 69 chemicals (among the 7,000+ chemicals) in tobacco cigarettes that are known to cause cancer. Only 1 chemical in tobacco cigarettes is in e-liquid. This chemical is not one of the 69 chemicals known to cause cancer. All in all, I say e-cigs are relatively a good alternative to tobacco cigarettes. I use them and I have to say they're pretty good. I no longer have a smoker's cough. I can breathe easier. I don't get winded doing exercise or going up or down stairs. I think the benefits alone are much better than tobacco cigarettes. If you still have doubts and think there's more to it than that, fine. Don't use them. That's your choice. I'm not pushing them on anyone or trying to make people quit smoking. If you want to get lung cancer and die of emphysema, go ahead. I can't stop you. But, please stop with the vapor-bashing. It's ridiculous. Show some real evidence that they are dangerous and I may consider it. But don't make things up and believe everything you read on facebook about them. You have a brain. Use it.",https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=353457771530302&set=a.106154599593955.1073741828.100005982458787&type=1,A man vaping an e-cig.,,,Public,,levelOfComfort,,yes

1477,6,"had a very Hunger Games-ish dream. (This one is super long, in case you don't have the time to sit here reading about a dream.) I was trying to join up with whatever this huge, deadly game was, but real me still doesn't know my motivation. Dream me had some very specific reason to feel the need to be in these games, despite the risk.The first part of the games involved shooting an oddly shaped arrow through a hole in a cell with some people inside. The arrow looked fairly normal until the tip, which had 8 wooden dowels on the end making up two X shapes, and this arrow must be shot through an X-shaped hole in the cell's door. They presumably had ways to tell whether you cheated at this, since the whole place had some futuristic-looking technology. I felt pretty prepared for this part of the test to get in, since I had apparently practiced this recently. Before I made my shot, I noticed a fairly chubby guy that I recognized from somewhere in dream me's life. (Wow, ""me's doesn't show up as wrong in spellcheck?) This guy looked really discouraged, and was just kind of fiddling with his bow and arrows, but not drawing them. Before I made my shot, I decided to help him out and give him a few pointers, even though he might become future competition. Wow, that is pretty Hunger Games-ish! Get some original dreams, brain!The next part of the tests involved staking your claim in a huge area with several large, metallic rectangles. The claim system involved a bunch of holes in the ground all over the area with a digital display floating in midair above them. This display showed a number, and the numbers represented each of the teams that were playing. I wasn't sure of the team number that most of my friends were going to be on, so I planned on seeking out some numbers, memorizing them, then checking up on my friends' cell to see which number to take. (Not sure why I didn't check that first) I ran around the area, sometimes jumping across the rectangles, but mostly on the ground since I didn't want to be seen. I was really trying to be stealthy, so this might have been an area where people are allowed to attack already. I kept coming across claimed spots, which were tiny x-shaped holes in the ground with a small digital display hovering just barely above the ground, which kind of flickered as something passed through it. I eventually found a small amount of unclaimed spots, and started running and hopping through the area to go see whether these numbers were team that any of my friends were on. I heard a noise, and slowed down and peeked around a corner. There was a group of people that had banded together and were coming this way. I quickly thought about it, and realized that I might run out of spots if I hesitate, so I picked one of the nearest spots and hoped for the best! I pulled out a small flag from somewhere on my back that had metal prongs similar to the dowels on the arrow, and stabbed it into one of the nearest holes. The hole produced a blue ray of light and the flag shrunk and became digitized with a Hollywood stock sound effect. The glow started to envelop me, and then I saw a third person view of me disappearing into the blue light, just as the group that was coming near rounds the corner!The next test was an obstacle course that nobody gets the benefit of seeing beforehand. The point to the obstacle course is to see if you can think on your feet well enough, as well as testing your endurance and physical ability. This is the part I was feeling uneasy about, but I remembered that I had to be in these games and I had no other option. I ran across the obstacle course, and was actually doing pretty well! The obstacle course consisted of similar shapes to the previous area, but they were a slightly different shade of dull-future-gray-metal, and they slanted and twisted and odd points. There were no moving parts, so it was fairly easy for dream me to look ahead and plan out a parkour path, basically. I was finally reaching a point where I didn't see much ahead of me, and there were three long, slanted platforms that I was taking ridiculously long leaps to get across. They seemingly led to a dead end, but as I made the final leap, I noticed a pair of metal doors opening beneath me. I made this same jump a few times, each time peeking at what was through those doors. I noticed a long display of numbers from 10 down to 1 (1 being the farthest from the starting point), and after 1 was a glowing, light blue panel that looked like the finish line. I made one final jump downward, and coordinated my movements like it was a Mario jump so that I landed on the edge of that last panel. A loud sound indicating that I was done had sounded, and a floating digital display started immediately showing me my results. I didn't think I could do it beforehand, but I was feeling really good about what I had accomplished, so I was all prepped up for a perfect score! The display showed a bunch of numbers and calculations, and then finally my score, which was just a little bit less than perfect. I said ""Oh, come on!"", and the display proceeded to show my my final landing on the panel and that it was very off center and my stance looked like I was tackled from the side by an invisible assailant as I landed. I didn't quite agree, since I landed fine and could have corrected it, had I known that would be part of the score, but I quickly realized that the score I got was nothing to complain about! I wonder if that was my dream trying not to make my character a M*** S**?That was when I woke up! I didn't even get to see these games; it was just the tests leading up to the games for the whole dream! Then again, had the dream kept going, I might not have finished typing this up in time for work!",,,,,friendsoffriends,,isDefault,,yes
